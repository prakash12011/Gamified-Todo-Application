# Supabase Configuration Fix for Email Verification Issues

## Problem
The application is experiencing persistent PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) errors during email verification, causing users to be unable to complete signup.

## Root Cause
1. Email confirmation links are expiring before users can click them
2. PKCE code verifiers are not persisting properly across browser redirects
3. Site URL configuration mismatch between development and production

## Quick Fix Solution

### Step 1: Disable Email Confirmation (Temporary)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to: **Authentication** → **Settings**
3. Find "Email Confirmation" setting
4. **Uncheck "Enable email confirmations"**
5. Click **Save**

This allows users to sign up immediately without email verification.

### Step 2: Update Site URL Configuration
1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
2. Set **Site URL** to: `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
3. Set **Redirect URLs** to:
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
   - `https://your-production-domain.com/auth/callback` (when deploying)
   - `https://your-production-domain.com/dashboard` (when deploying)

### Step 3: Simplified Auth Flow
The application now uses a simplified authentication form that:
- ✅ Handles immediate signup without email confirmation
- ✅ Creates user profiles automatically upon successful signup
- ✅ Redirects directly to dashboard after authentication
- ✅ Avoids complex PKCE email verification flow

## Alternative: Re-enable Email Confirmation Later

Once the app is stable, you can re-enable email confirmation by:

1. Going back to **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. **Check "Enable email confirmations"**
3. Ensure all redirect URLs are properly configured
4. Test the email verification flow thoroughly

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Immediate User Experience**: Users can start using the app right away
2. **Reduced Complexity**: No PKCE token handling or email verification issues
3. **Better Development**: Easier to test authentication during development
4. **Scalable**: Can add email verification back when needed

## Security Note

While disabling email confirmation reduces initial security, it's a common practice during development and MVP phases. You can always enable it later when the core functionality is stable.
